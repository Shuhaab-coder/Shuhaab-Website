        Hi, I&apos;m Shuhaab. I love technology and innovation. I have a background
        in development, working on projects like Agro Ratna, which is a platform
        aimed at improving agricultural practices. I also enjoy exploring new
        tools, frameworks, and solving problems creatively.
